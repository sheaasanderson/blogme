# BlogMe Sentiment Analysis

I want to run a simple sentiment analysis on a blogging site to find out which articles and news sources are most popular by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

## Description

BlogMe, a famous blogging business, has a dataset of news articles that they need further analysis on. 

First, they'd like keywords to be extracted from headlines of the article. Second, they would need to determine the sentiment of the news articles.

The data is in an excel file and they would like to see a dashboard outlying sentiment, top articles, etc.
